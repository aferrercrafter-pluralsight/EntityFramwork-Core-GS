### Loading Related Data ###


* Eager via Include() EF -> EF6 / EF Core
* Eager via Projection EF -> EF6 / Not Quite
* Explicit Load EF -> EF6 / EF Core
* Lazy Loading EF -> EF6 / EF Core

```c#
private static void EagerLoadWithInclude()
        {
            var samurai = _context.Samurais.First();            
            _context.Samurais.Include(s => s.Quotes).FirstOrDefault().Quotes.Add(new Quote { Text = "Gomu gomu nooo Jet Pistol" });            
            _context.SaveChanges();
        }
```
Each Samurai _(main entity)_ should come with his quotes _(realted entity)_. This is rendered as two different commnads to the DB, one for queryng the samurais _(main entity)_, and a second one to return the Quotes _(related entity)_. __(One to Many)__
EF Core create multiples queries to avoid:
* flattening data
* returning redundant results 
* better performance

__Include loads the entire ser of related objects__
(you cannot filter the related data or order it)

__Multi level Include__

```c#
private static void EagerLoadManyToManyAkaChildrenGrandChildren()
        {
            using (var context = new SamuraiContext())
            {
                var samuraiWithBattles = context.Samurais
                .Include(s => s.SamuraiBattles)
                .ThenInclude(sb => sb.Battle).ToList();
            }
        }
```
`ThenInclude()` is an include for the result of the first `Include()`

__Multi Branch Include__

```c#
private static void EagerLoadingWithMultipleBranches()
        {
            using (var context = new SamuraiContext())
            {
                var samuraiWithQuotesAndSecretIdentity = context.Samurais
                .Include(s => s.Quotes)
                .Include(s => s.SecretIdentity).ToList();
            }
        }
```

Quotes _(related coletion entity)_ itÂ´s rendered as a new commnad, but SecretIdentity _(One to One Relation)_ is included in the first command as a Left Join when getting the Samurais _(main entity)_. Only collections relateds entity need a second separate command.

__FromSql Include__

```c#
private static void EagerLoadWithFromSql()
        {
            using (var context = new SamuraiContext())
            {
                var samuraisWithQuotes = context.Samurais.FromSql("SELECT * FROM Samurais").Include(s => s.Quotes).ToList();
            }
        }
```

The FromSql query is executed first, then another command for the inlcude is executed.
